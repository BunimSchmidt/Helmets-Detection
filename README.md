## This project is a helmet detector implemented in Python with OpenCV and Tensorflow.

### Download Tensorflow models

the project uses the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco model to detect humans and a Tensorflow model to detect helmets.
it is too heavy uploading it to GitHub. so please download these 2 models from Google Drive.
